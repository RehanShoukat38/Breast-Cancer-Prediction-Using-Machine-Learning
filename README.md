# ü©∫ Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project predicts whether a breast tumor is **benign** or **malignant** using a **logistic regression classifier** trained on real diagnostic data.  
The entire workflow was built and tested on **Google Colab** using Python libraries like **Pandas** and **scikit-learn**.

## üìÇ Dataset

- **Source:** [Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data) ‚Äî available on **Kaggle**.
- **Features:** 30 numeric features describing characteristics of cell nuclei present in breast mass images.
- **Target:** Diagnosis ‚Äî `M` (Malignant) or `B` (Benign).

## ‚úÖ Problem Statement

> **Goal:** Develop a binary classification model that can accurately predict the presence of breast cancer based on diagnostic measurements.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- **Google Colab** ‚Äî for interactive Python notebooks and GPU/CPU compute.
- **Pandas** ‚Äî for data cleaning, exploration, and manipulation.
- **scikit-learn (sklearn)** ‚Äî for logistic regression and model evaluation.
- **NumPy** ‚Äî for numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** ‚Äî for data visualization.
